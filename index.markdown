## Challenges and Opportunities of Large Language Models in Real-World Machine Learning Applications.
<em> A Workshop Colocated with ECML-PKDD in Turin, Italy and Online in September, 2023 </em>


Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have the potential to revolutionize the
way we interact with language-based applications in the real world. However, they also
come with their set of challenges that need to be addressed to ensure their effective
and ethical use. Especially in real-world Machine Learning applications, LLMs have a
disruptive potential, but require a carefully designed set of techniques and best
practices to avoid a surge in compute cost, risks of producing untruthful or harmful
content, and/or an inefficient utilization of their capabilities.
This workshop will specifically focus on the opportunities and challenges of LLMs in
real-world Machine Learning applications and will cover topics such as synthetic data
generation, model evaluation and testing, fairness, debiasing, cold-start, distillation, and
prompting. It will also welcome stories of LLM usage in specific applications, such as
Chat, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, and/or Spoken Language
Understanding.

has been leading the science of Question Answering science since 2018. He obtained his
Ph.D. in CS from the University of Rome in 2003, and then did his postdoc at The University
of Texas at Dallas for two years. In 2007, he joined the CS Dept. of the University of Trento,
Italy. Since 2009 to 2011, he participated to the Jeopardy! Grand Challenge with the IBM
Watson Research center, and collaborated with them until 2015. He was a Principal
Scientist of the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) for five years (2013-2018). His
expertise concerns theoretical and applied machine learning in the areas of NLP, IR and
Data Mining. He is well-known for his work on structural kernels and neural networks for
syntactic/semantic inference over text, documented by more than 300 scientific articles. He
has received four IBM Faculty Awards, one Google Faculty Award, and five best paper
awards. He was the General Chair of EMNLP 2014, a PC co-Chair of CoNLL 2015, and has
had a chair role in more than 70 conferences and workshops. He is currently an
action/associate editor of ACM Computing Survey and JAIR, and General Chair of EACL 2023. 
He has led more than 25 research projects, e.g., with MIT CSAIL.
