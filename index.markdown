## Challenges and Opportunities of Large Language Models in Real-World Machine Learning Applications.
<em> A Workshop Colocated with ECML-PKDD in Turin, Italy and Online in September, 2023 </em>


Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have the potential to revolutionize the
way we interact with language-based applications in the real world. However, they also
come with their set of challenges that need to be addressed to ensure their effective
and ethical use. Especially in real-world Machine Learning applications, LLMs have a
disruptive potential, but require a carefully designed set of techniques and best
practices to avoid a surge in compute cost, risks of producing untruthful or harmful
content, and/or an inefficient utilization of their capabilities.
This workshop will specifically focus on the opportunities and challenges of LLMs in
real-world Machine Learning applications and will cover topics such as synthetic data
generation, model evaluation and testing, fairness, debiasing, cold-start, distillation, and
prompting. It will also welcome stories of LLM usage in specific applications, such as
Chat, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, and/or Spoken Language
Understanding.
